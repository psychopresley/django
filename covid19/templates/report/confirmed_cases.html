    <br><h3>I. Daily cases</h3>

    <p><br>

      In the map below each pulse represents the confirmed cases in the country. The larger the pulse is
      the higher is the number of infections confirmed that day. This gives us the idea of how fast
      the virus has spread and also the intensity of the wave in each country. The counter sums up the
      total confirmed cases per day. The map is interactive so you can change the period for the counter
      and also if you're interested in the rate of spread or the aggregated numbers.

    <h3>II. The outbreak</h3>

    <p><br>

      One well known specificity of some outbreaks is the 'wave' behaviour of the rate of contamination in the
      society. The graphic below helps us to visualize how each country has faced the outbreak. The values shown
      here illustrate the aggregate number of new infections / month. This is important to visualize the wave
      behaviour in some countries or if a certain country has faced the outbreak sooner or it's about to face it.

    </p>

    <p><br>

      The two graphics below help us visualize the 'wave' behaviour of the pandemics. In the first one it is
      possible to select a certain country and check the darker areas where the number of confirmed cases is
      higher. Select, as an example, Australia in the dropdown menu and you'll see the two distinct moments that
      indicate a peak in the spread of the virus.

    <p><br>

      The second graphic below represents the aggregate numbers in a monthly basis. As an example I show you the
      graphic for my home country, Brazil. If you hover over the highlighted line you will see the contribution of
      each month as a percentage of the total number of infections, which means that according to the chart, 17.5%
      of all infections from coronavirus occurred in december while only 0.1% occurred in january 20'. Search the
      desired country to check the numbers. You can also select from the filter menu a specific region for better
      visualization.
