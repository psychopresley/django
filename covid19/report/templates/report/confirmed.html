          In the map below each pulse represents the confirmed cases in the country. The larger the pulse is
          the higher is the number of infections confirmed that day. This gives us the idea of how fast
          the virus has spread and also the intensity of the wave in each country. The counter sums up the
          total confirmed cases per day. The map is interactive so you can change the period for the counter
          and also if you're interested in the rate of spread or the aggregated numbers.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">II. The outbreak</h2>
        <p class="lead"> One well known specificity of some outbreaks is the 'wave' behaviour of the rate of contamination in the
          society. The graphic below helps us to visualize how each country has faced the outbreak. The values shown
          here illustrate the aggregate number of new infections / month. This is important to visualize the wave
          behaviour in some countries or if a certain country has faced the outbreak sooner or it's about to face it.
