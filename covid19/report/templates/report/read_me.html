          Hi, there! This page is supposed to be just a cool way to visualize some aspects of the coronavirus outbreak, so you
          won't find here any deep analysis, modelling or advanced machine learning estimation of the near future. I will
          acknowledge here most of the tools that made possible to build this page and also provide some links if you're interested
          in a more deep analysis of the pandemics.

        </p>

        <p>

          All graphics on this page were build with <a href="https://flourish.studio/">Flourish Studio</a>.
          It's a very interesting web based visualization app with the option of creating storytellers, which is a cool way to
          present your data. As an example you can check my own storytelling for this project <a href="https://public.flourish.studio/story/516016/">here</a>.
          So, if you are interested in dive deep in the numbers here it is a few pages I recommend you to visit:

          <ul style="text-align: justify">
            <li>Original data source:  All rights reserved to <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/">Johns Hopkins University</a></li>
            <li>JHU visual dashboard. That's the most confident page to get real time data: <a href=" https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">JHU CSSE</a></li>
            <li>If you're interested in checking my work just visit my project repository at github: <a href="https://github.com/psychopresley/COVID-19"> project repository</a></li>
            <li>Also, my own visual dashboard, build with Tableau public. There you will find a deeper analysis of the pandemics
              with much more visualization options. It's worth to take a look: <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/psychopresley#!/vizhome/Covid19_15951776377290/Dashboard">The Covid-19 Dashboard</a></li>
            <li>I also made available a dataset with the compiled numbers. It has some saved queries that can be run and provide you with
              cool information about the pandemics. Feel free to explore it! <a href="https://data.world/psychopresley/covid19tracking/workspace">Tracking the covid-19</a></li>

              This page is powered by Django 3.5 and Python 3.9. I use Booststrap 5 for styling. The available data is collected
              from the original github repository and cleaned to build the dataset that provides all the information presented here.
              The dataset is updated daily.
