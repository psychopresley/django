        <p class="lead"><br>

          One way to visualize the impact of the Sars-Cov-2 outbreak in the world is to divide it
          into geopolitical regions. It is natural to assume that the numbers are higher in the regions
          with higher economic activity and trade level with China, where the first cases of infection
          were reported. Below you will find the numbers by geopolitical region as defined by the WHO.
          <!-- <br>
          It's important to notice in advance that the number presented here are collected from several oficial
          reports emitted by the governments and not all data is confident. Some countries, counties or
          provinces, for example, don't report the recovered cases. The US, Sweden and Belgium are just a few examples.
          Also, totalitarian regimes tend to cover their real numbers. Still, this is the best approximation we have
          from the real state of the world. -->

        <p class="lead">Now imagine that the total number of people infected by the Sars-cov-2 virus since the beginning of the
                outbreak is scaled down to a group of 1000 people gathered together in a room. This would be the distribution
                of cases according to the region of origin of the members in that group. Select the case you're interested
                in and hover the mouse over the map below to visualize the numbers by region.

          <p class="lead">Each country has performed differently in the fight against the coronavirus, depending on several factors
          such as political decisions, climate, war, HDI and social behaviour. The chart below
          separates all countries according to the chosen aspect. For example, in the 'shade by' menu select the
          "active cases interval" option and you'll see which countries have few or high cases.
          The 'median with quartiles' method is used here to define the "high/few" cases and all cases are taken as a
          percentage of the total of confirmed infections. You can also group countries and compare them using any criteria
          at your disposal, so feel free to explore it!

          of interest to check the numbers as well as order the table by case in ascending or descending order. The bar
          chart gives a good idea of how much of the total confirmed cases are actually active. As stated in the first
          item of this section, not all countries report the recovered cases so you may also check here which ones fall
          in this category.
